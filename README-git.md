To run locally: note that the second variable declaration is for a const backendUrl. There are two versions, one commented out. Ensure that the one for http://localhost is the active version.

Also, I believe using 'npm install --save react-router-dom' will handle installing missing dependencies. For more info: https://create-react-app.dev/docs/installing-a-dependency/

after your server is running (api), use 'npm start' in Terminal.
